# Coding-the-amazon-echo
Extend the capabilities of the amazon echo by having it connect to your chosen database and have new voice commands to perform a particular task.

This is a simple POC where one can say the airline they would like to hear information about and Alexa would tell the total sales amount for that particular airline.

index.js file handles the connection to database.
